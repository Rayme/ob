title: "Why and how I use Quartz"
---

I have a private [[TiddlyWiki]], a blog and a digital garden for now. At first I thought a note-taking app and a blog would be enough for me, then years later I found that should there be a platform between a note-taking app and a blog where I publish my notes those yet completed, raw and willing to share. Here it comes digital garden. I may consider it following the trend (which it actually is), people somehow like this model.

Like I mentioned in [[Why I host a new site]], TiddlyWiki takes way too long to load. The main reason (also the main feature) is that TiddlyWiki is Single File Application, it loads ALL contents all at once. Which means if you put over 10M of contents, it renders the page after all 10M is downloaded.

I like the pilosophy of [[Obsidian]]. It is basically an Markdown editor. People just write Markdown files in it and link them to each other if needed. a thought came to my mind: what if I am able to choose which files/notes I want to publish from my vault/folder with one single button? That would be a bit more elegant than using TiddlyWiki, which is entirely front-ended. Then I was told Quartz, based on Hugo and GitHub. Damn it is wonderful and easy!

Here are some ideas of how I want to use Quartz:

- some notes from my previous garden can be placed here, with a nicer way of presentation;
- articles I've written before that I consider 'Evergreen';
- Ideas that are better presented as a topic.

This could increase and it certainly will.
