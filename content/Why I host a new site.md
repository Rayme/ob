title: "Why I host a new site"
---

Huhexian told me that he successfully runs a Quartz locally. I said yeah that's cool, let me know when it goes online. In the night of that day, he sent me the link and I was like yeah that looks like something I wanted too.

So I started this right after. Firstly I forked the repo from jzhao who is the developer of Quartz, then I installed GitHub Desktop and Go (which I found it useless to me for now) and pulled the repo to my hard drive.

Then I opened [[Obsidian]] and opened a vault in /ob/content folder (I changed the folder name). After a little setup, I successfully pushed this vault/folder to GitHub and the site went online with the URL rayme.github.io/ob .

Then I ran into domain and DNS setup issues. I found Huhexian ran into them too. I read an article he sent me, then I solved the problem. Here it is, a brand new site, probably another so called digital garden.

I host a digital garden already with [[TiddlyWiki]] on Node.js on my VPS and I find it wonderful. But it is not perfect though. The reasons why I use Quartz are:

1. The TiddlyWiki file is TOO big. Friends told me that he spends about one minute to load my site. That is really disturbing.
2. I edit notes on a browser (that's the only way). So I have to backup the single HTML file everytime I commit changes to the TiddlyWiki. I can automate this flow but I am a lazy guy.
3. The TiddlyWiki runs into issues sometimes when editing. In my opinion, TiddlyWiki on Node.js saves changes even there is only one character edited or added. So it saves an empty note/tiddler when the network connection is not well.

There are other downsides of using TiddlyWiki as a digital garden (or a simple website). I am not saying that TiddlyWiki is not good, it is a great Open Source note-taking app with a long history. When I found Obsidian in 2021, I love its 'links between notes', 'completely offline functionality' and 'based on plain text' features. The paid feature Obsidian Publish is great for a website out of the box too. Therefore, a few free Obsidian Publish alternatives came up. This is when I wanted to setup one for myself, even though I yet didn't fully thought out what to use it for.
